# Alphabet Recognition
This project recognizes handwritten characters, i.e, English alphabets from A-Z. This is achieved by modeling a neural network that will have to be trained over a dataset containing images of alphabets.
# Required frameworks:
Numpy (version 1.16.5)
Keras (version 2.3.1)
Tensorflow (Keras uses TensorFlow in backend and for some image preprocessing) (version 2.0.0)
Matplotlib (version 3.1.1)
Pandas (version 0.25.1)
# Dataset:
The dataset for this project contains 372450 images of alphabets of 28Ã—2, all present in the form of a CSV file can be downloaded from: https://www.kaggle.com/sachinpatel21/az-handwritten-alphabets-in-csv-format
